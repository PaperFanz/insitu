# Contributing to Insitu

InSitu by itself is nothing more than a platform; its real utility comes when users implement and share their own filters for others to use. To get started with your own filter, please read through [FILTERS.md](FILTERS.md). To contribute directly to the InSitu project, such as fixing bugs in the user interface or implementing suggestions for the plugin system, please refer to the To-Do list.

## To-Do

- [ ] implement example/common filters (assignee @EAkita)
- [ ] break out filtered view as standalone RQT plugin (assignee none)
- [ ] optionally republish filtered image stream (assignee none)
- [ ] save and restore modes, views, and filters from configuration file (assignee @PaperFanz)
- [x] 'Edit filter' interface (assignee @PaperFanz)
- [x] script for creating filter templates (assignee @PaperFanz)
